Hi, I’m Rahid.

I spend a lot of time trying to understand how software works,
especially the parts that sit behind the scenes.

I’m interested in how systems come together,
and I often look at problems from more than one side.

Most of my work lives here.
Projects are at different stages, reflecting ongoing work and iteration.

I’m not tied to a single domain.
Learning as I go is part of how I build and improve.

> Build. Learn. Build again.
